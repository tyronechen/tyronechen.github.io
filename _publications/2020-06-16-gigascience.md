In this review, we perform a critical analysis of methods with the explicit aim of harmonising data, as opposed to case-specific integration. This revealed that matrix factorisation, latent variable analysis, and deep learning are potent strategies. Finally, we describe the properties of an ideal universal data harmonisation framework.
