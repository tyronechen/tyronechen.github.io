*2019*

Awarded a prize for an oral presentation and associated poster presented as part of the Data Fluency Digital Toolkit Poster Competition 2019 held in Monash University.

My poster was selected for this prize by a judging panel including Monash University Library, the Bioinformatics platform, eResearch and Data Futures Institute, based on the poster's content, design and aesthetics, innovation and originality, data visualisation and interdisciplinary approach.

The poster outlines how I use tools taught in the Data Fluency Community of Practice in my research where I am applying deep learning to harmonise high throughput sequencing data from different modalities. From this data, it will be possible to identify global patterns of gene regulation.

[The poster is publicly available here.](https://doi.org/10.26180/5de98972a2661)
