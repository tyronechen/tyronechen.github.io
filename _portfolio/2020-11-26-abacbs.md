*2020*

Awarded a prize for an oral presentation as part of the annual Australian Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Conference held in the Australian National University, Australia. *Session was virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.*

My talk was selected for this prize by popular vote from the conference delegates.

The talk describes the importance of multi-omics data harmonisation in biology, and outlines a reusable, open-source pipeline. To the resulting information, a consensus of multiple molecular docking methods are applied for computational SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.
