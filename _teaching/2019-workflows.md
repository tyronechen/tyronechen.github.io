*2019*

[Facilitated a hybrid training session for researchers](https://www.massive.org.au/events/implementing-scalable-bioinformatic-workflows-in-snakemake-nextflow/) for workflow management systems such as [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Participants learn methods to increase the reproducibility of their data analyses. This is particularly important in the case of large analysis workflows, since they are fragile ecosystems of software tools, scripts and dependencies.

This workshop was organised by [EMBL Australia](https://www.emblaustralia.org/).
