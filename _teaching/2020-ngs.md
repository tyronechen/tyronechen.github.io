*2020*

Taught biological researchers [introductory programming and how to analyse next generation sequencing data](https://tsonika.github.io/NGS-SBS-Monash2019/).

The Introduction to NGS Data Analysis is a three-day, hands-on workshop that offers attendees a basic understanding of NGS data analysis workflows. The workshop provides hands-on computational experience in analysis of NGS data using common analytical approaches for QC, Alignment, RNA-Seq data and de novo genome assembly. This workshop was delivered using a mixture of lectures, hands-on practical sessions, and open discussions.

Topics covered by this workshop include:

- An Introduction to the command line interface and NGS file formats
- An introduction to R programming
- Quality control of sequencing data
- NGS read alignment
- Basic RNA-Seq differential expression analysis
- Short and long read de novo genome assembly

This workshop was developed by Bioplatforms Australia, in partnership with CSIRO, and with support from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), a member of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in the UK. The workshop content has been maintained and updated by a network of dedicated [bioinformatics trainers](http://www.bioplatforms.com/bioinformatics-training/) from around Australia.
