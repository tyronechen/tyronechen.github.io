*2022*

Invited to train researchers on how to apply machine learning to biological data as part of the [6th InSyb (International Symposium on Bioinformatics)](https://bbc-insyb.akademisi.co.id/). In this workshop, participants downloaded, preprocessed, tokenised and applied tree-based classification algorithms to biological sequence data.

[The International Symposium on Bioinformatics (InSyB)](https://insyb.apbionet.org/) bridges the gap between InCoB (International Conference on Bioinformatics) and irregular local APBioNet-supported workshops or training courses. The one or two day annual InSyB is expected to be centred on topics relevant to the local organizer. A mix of keynotes, short talks, discussions, poster sessions, and “meet the expert” opportunities shall foster an interactive environment for integrated bioinformatics research and education.
