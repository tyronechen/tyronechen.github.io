This workshop was a meeting of minds, bringing together researchers from the Monash University who work closely on human language across all disciplines (i.e., Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Cognition and Neuroscience, Philosophy, Education, Behavioural Sciences, Tools and Applications)  for a half day event of presentations, and informal networking.

The event took place in person on Clayton campus in mid-November, and is open to Monash University researchers, students, and guests. The event is co-organised by the Faculty of IT and the Faculty of Arts, and funded by the Early Career Academic Committee of the Faculty of IT.Â
