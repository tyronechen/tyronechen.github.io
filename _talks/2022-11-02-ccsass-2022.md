The CCS Graduate Research Student Committee (CGRSC) are pleased to bring you the 15th Annual Student Symposium this Wednesday 2nd of November on Level 5 Alfred Centre. The symposium is the highlight of the graduate research calendar as it brings together students from across the precinct to showcase their innovative and diverse research projects. This year we are fortunate to have Prof Jayashri Kulkarni AO from the Department of Psychiatry as our keynote speaker.

[We have linked the program of the event which includes a list of all the fantastic student abstracts.](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/3079533/CGRSC-Studyent-Symposium-Booklet_2022.pdf) The event will be run in-person, and we welcome you to attend and support your fellow graduate research students at the school. However if you are unable to attend in-person, a Zoom link for the Oral and Science Byte presentation sessions can be found on Page 2 of the Symposium program.
