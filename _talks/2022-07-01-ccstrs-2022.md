This year sees Monash University’s 8th Annual Translational Research Symposium. The symposium will showcase the translational research achievements and current activities of Monash’s three metropolitan clinical schools – Central Clinical School, Eastern Health and the School of Clinical Sciences.

Every year the symposium presents an outstanding scientific program featuring leading translational researchers from the three Monash clinical schools and invited speakers from Australia’s premier research institutes. This year we are honoured to host Prof Maria Makrides from SAMHRI as our Keynote Speaker and Prof Nicholas Huntington from the BDI, Monash University in our Plenary Session.

Poster presentations from our early career researchers in the lunch time session will be a highlight of the day.
